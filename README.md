# Location Inference of Tweets: A Performance Comparison of Name-Entity Recognizer and Probabilistic Models

## Abstract

Location information is often collected and used in marketing without informing netizens. Further research is thus essential to understand and evaluate the accuracy and capability of location inference methods. We compare the performance of a Name-Entity Recognizer and a probabilistic generative model on Twitter location inference with related works. Results show that both text-based methods do not scale well when applied to the contiguous United States.

## Dataset

We used the GeoText Twitter Dataset8 provided by Eisenstein et al. (2010). The GeoText dataset contains 380,000 tweets from 9,500 users in the contiguous United States, which were collected in the first week of March 2010. (http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ark/GeoText/)
